cherami-thrift 
==============

Cherami is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available message queue system we developed at Uber Engineering to transport asynchronous tasks. 

Cherami thrift holds the TChannel-Thrift APIs for cherami exposed to the outside world.
Getting started
---------------

To install cherami-thrift:

```
git clone git@github.com:uber/cherami-thrift.git
```

Developing
----------

The cherami-thrift.git branch specifically holds the thrift definition along with the autogenerated code for the thrift APIs.

There are a bunch of dependencies for Cherami which needs to be installed first before getting started:
* Make certain that `thrift` (OSX: `brew install thrift`) and `glide` are
in your path (above).
* `thrift-gen` is needed to autogenerate thrift APIs (`go get github.com/uber/tchannel-go/thrift/thrift-gen`)
* `cassandra` which is our metadata store.
* `rocksdb` to store our actual data.
* cherami-thrift.git repo
* cherami-client-go.git repo
* cherami-server.git repo

Once we have everything, you can do the following to build:
```
make bins
```
